3662 Mini-project - Change log



------------ V1.06	2019-12-12 ------------

1. Obscure bug corrected in SyntaxCheckStage1() in calculate_answer.c.
	(Bad handling of strings without triling NULL or overlong.)

------------ V1.05	2019-11-28 ------------

1. calculate_answer.c: both instances of exit(EXIT_FAILURE) moved inside 
	#if RUNNING_ON_PC statements. Reason: Tiva turns out not to have 
	exit().

------------ V1.04	2019-11-07 ------------

1. calculate_answer.c is now a fully working version, not just a 
	place-holder.
2. New program test_calcuator added. This runs on a PC/Mac/Linux box, not a Tiva, 
	and allows the user to experiment with the calculate_answer module.
3. README.txt file added with comments on what the software package contains.
4. Package file name changed from SourceFiles to SoftwarePackage.
	
------------ V1.03	2019-11-06 ------------

1. Definitions of register addresses for pull-down resistors added to 
	low_level_funcs_tiva.c, underneath those for pull-up resistors.

------------ V1.02	2019-10-18 ------------

1. Makefile added.

2. CHANGELOG.txt (this file) added.

3. Zipfile names now include version number.

4. main.c
4.1. Line 76: Call to ReadFloatFromFlash (old name) changed to ReadDoubleFromFlash 
	(new name).
4.2. Line 96: Call to WriteFloatToFlash (old name) changed to WriteDoubleToFlash 
	(new name).

5. low_level_funcs_tiva.h
5.1. Line 121: Declaration of function SendDisplayNibble lacked semicolon at end; 
	now added.
5.2. Line 202: Doxygen close-section command was //*} ; now corrected to //@} .

6. low_level_funcs_tiva.c
6.1. Line 208: Definition of function SetPrintPosition lacked } at end; now added.
6.2. Lines 96-113: Removed requirement to define values of the addresses needed to 
	set up the clocks. Reason: these are already defined in PLL.h which is 
	#included by TExaS.h, which is #included by low_level_funcs_tiva.c.

------------ V1.01	2019-10-17 ------------
#define constants added at top of low_level_funcs_tiva.c.
